[2012-01-23 19:05] ATTENTION UDEV:
[2012-01-23 19:05] ----------
[2012-01-23 19:05] Kernel 2.6.32 or newer is now required.
[2012-01-23 19:05]   --
[2012-01-23 19:05] OSS emulation modules are not loaded by default, add to rc.conf if needed.
[2012-01-23 19:05]   --
[2012-01-23 19:05] Arch specific cd symlinks are now no longer created.
[2012-01-23 19:05]   --
[2012-01-23 19:05] cd and net persistent rules will no longer be autogenerated,
[2012-01-23 19:05] see <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Udev> for details.
[2012-01-23 19:05]   --
[2012-01-23 19:05] Errors are now logged (possibly to the console) by default.
[2012-01-23 19:05]   --
[2012-01-23 19:05] Arch's custom blacklisting logic has been removed. MOD_AUTOLOAD and
[2012-01-23 19:05] blacklisting in MODULES no longer works.
[2012-01-23 19:05] See 'man modprobe.conf' for a replacement to blacklisting.
[2012-01-23 19:05] To disable a module mod1 on the kernel command line, use
[2012-01-23 19:05] mod1.disable=1
[2012-01-23 19:05] or
[2012-01-23 19:05] modprobe.blacklist=mod1
[2012-01-23 19:05]   --
[2012-01-23 19:05] The following modules are no longer unconditionally loaded:
[2012-01-23 19:05]   pcspkr irtty-sir analog lp ppdev ide-generic
[2012-01-23 19:05] Add them to MODULES in rc.conf if you need them.
[2012-01-23 19:05]   --
[2012-01-23 19:05] Blacklisting of framebuffer devices has moved from /etc/modprobe.d to
[2012-01-23 19:05] /lib/modprobe.d. Any customizations shoud be done to the file in /etc, as it
[2012-01-23 19:05] takes precedence.
[2012-01-23 19:05]   --
[2012-01-23 19:05] kbd and rtc devices are no longer world readable.
[2012-01-23 19:05]   --
[2012-01-23 19:05] rtc is no longer in the audio group and fb devices are no longer in
[2012-01-23 19:05] the video group, as permissions and ownership of fb devices are controlled
[2012-01-23 19:05] by X.
[2012-01-23 19:05]   --
[2012-01-23 19:05] We now use upstream rules for assigning devices to the 'disk', 'optical',
[2012-01-23 19:05] 'scanner' and 'video' groups. Beware of any changes.
[2012-01-23 19:05]   --
[2012-01-23 19:05] We no longer create symlinks from /dev/<dev> to /dev/<dev>0.
[2012-01-23 19:05]   --
[2012-01-23 19:05] For security reasons, we no longer add devices to the 'storage' group. Use
[2012-01-23 19:05] udisks and friends, or add custom rules to /etc/udev.d/rules/, if you want
[2012-01-23 19:05] this functionality back.
[2012-01-23 19:05]  --
[2012-01-23 19:05] We no longer create the static nodes on install needed for an initrd-less boot
[2012-01-23 19:05] where devtmpfs is not mounted by the kernel, this only affects fresh installs.
[2012-01-23 19:05]  --
[2012-01-23 19:05] devtmpfs support is now a hard requirement. Users of the official Arch kernels
[2012-01-23 19:05] have this enabled.
